# About me
My name is Selina (she/her/hers). I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University and have earned an undergraduate degree in Business Management at the University of Queensland. I have accumulated valuable internship experiences across various domains, including data analysis, business development, and market research, and I hope to pursue a career as a Business Analyst or Product Manager.

# What I hope to learn
Here are 4 main points that I want to learn from the course:

1. **Data Storytelling Techniques:** I hope to practice techniques for telling a story with data, such as the use of annotations, color, and layout to highlight key points and trends.
2. **Visual Communication:** I hope I can be familiar with principles of effective visual communication, which involve using design principles to make your data visualizations more engaging and easier to understand.
3. **Narrative Structure:** I hope to understand how to structure the data and insights into a coherent and compelling narrative. This involves identifying key messages and how to present them effectively.
4. **Data Visualization:** I hope to practice creating compelling data visualizations using tools like Excel, Tableau, or Python libraries. This includes creating various types of charts, graphs, and infographics.

Mastering data storytelling techniques can empower my desired career path as a business analyst or product manager to make data-driven decisions, communicate effectively with stakeholders, engage audiences, prioritize tasks, and solve complex problems. It can enhance my ability to present data insights persuasively, making the work more impactful and facilitating successful projects and product development.
